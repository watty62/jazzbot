# jazzbot

This is a prototype Jazz Bot which will answer questions about my jazz album collection.

It responds to a range of commands: album, how many, what and help. The latter prompts the user to use valid entry.

So far it only returns dummy responses. 

It is highly inspired by my friend [Andrew Sage](http://twitter.com/symboticaandrew)'s [Slackbot](https://github.com/andrewsage/slackbot) but is not done in an Object Oriented way. We were both inspired by Matt Makai's [Slack Starterbot](https://github.com/mattmakai/slack-starterbot/)

At the time of writing I still have to hook the queries up to a SQLite database of albums.

My intention is to create somthing that I can query from afar and it will tell me if I have a particular album.
